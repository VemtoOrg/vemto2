# Getting Started with Vemto 2

Welcome to Vemto 2! This guide will help you understand how to use this powerful database design and code generation tool.

## What is Vemto 2?

Vemto 2 is a visual database schema designer that helps you create and manage your application's database structure. It allows you to:

- Design database tables and relationships visually
- Configure models for your application
- Generate migrations for your database
- Manage your schema efficiently

## First Steps

When you first open Vemto 2, you'll see the main schema design interface. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Schema Canvas**: The main area where you'll design your database tables and their relationships
2. **Toolbar**: Located at the top, contains tools for adding tables, zooming, searching, and more
3. **Table Options**: When you select a table, this panel appears to let you configure columns, models, and more

## Creating Your First Table

To create your first table:

1. Click the "+" button in the toolbar or use the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + T`
2. Enter a name for your table (use singular nouns for best practices)
3. Select whether you want to create a default model for this table (recommended)
4. Click "Create"

Your new table will appear on the schema canvas. You can now:
- Add columns to your table
- Configure the table's model
- Create relationships with other tables
